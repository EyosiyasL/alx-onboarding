##Pseudo code

Reads in three numbers and writes them all in sorted order

Ask to enter the  three numbers int a,b,c

IF a>b, a initialized to Max and b to SecMax

ELSE a=SecMax, b=Max

And IF c>Max, low=SecMax , SecMax=max , Max=c

ELSE IF C>SecMax, low=SecMax, SecMax=c

ELSE low=c

Generate the sorted order as a result
